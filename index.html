            Chaitanya is United State Army veteran and has over three years of proven experience in leadership, 
            management and technology. He accomplished measurable results as part of teams in a dynamic, fast 
            paced environment and possesses an intermediate background in designing website, Java, and data structures. 
            His problem solving derived from conducting domestic and global operations, and managed risk upon multiple
            lines to protect assets, property, and equipment valued over $750M while meeting the expectations of senior leadership. 
            Chaitanya was also recognized for my outstanding performance and professionalism while serving in the Army. He used his
            technical knowledge to create a tracking system to organize soldiers sensitive information and training while he was in 
            the Army and saved time of his superior. He is also a team player and eager to learn from his colleagues. His favorite 
            quote is <strong> <em>“try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value.” </em> </strong>
